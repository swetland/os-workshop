--- The VGA fonts in src/env/video/vgafonts.c (copyleft_vgafonts.txt)

This *compilation* is (c) Copyright 1991,1992 Joseph (Yossi) Gil.
Permission is granted to use and redistribute the files comprising
this collection in any way (including conversion to another format),
provided that my name and addresses and this notice is preserved.

Simple (dare I say trivial?) bitmapped screen fonts such as the ones
included in this collection cannot be copyrighted. In general, one can
only copyright programs that generate fonts. This is why postscript
fonts are copyrightable. For more details refer to discussions various
"legal" newsgroups. In addition, I have included a relevant excerpt
from the FAQ of comp.fonts at the bottom of this document.

No one can claim any copyright on the fonts in this archive. They
have been collected from numerous sources. Legally speaking, you are
*free* to do with the individual fonts whatever you like. Individual
fonts are in the public domain. I do ask that you will kindly refrain
from causing confusion by distributing modified versions of the fonts
contained in this collection.

Please send any all your EGA/VGA text mode fonts contributions to me
rather than distributing a modified version of this collection. I
will add your fonts to the next edition of this collection and happily
acknowledge your help. Your cooperation will enable us all to benefit
from your contribution. See the file LOOKING4.TXT for more details.

I am trying to keep track of the origins of these fonts. See the file
FONTORIG.TXT. Unfortunately, I only started to record this information
on version 1.2. Records of origin of earlier fonts are missing.
If you know the origin of any of the fonts here, please drop me a note.

Staring on version 1.6 the collection also includes some of the
miscellaneous utilities which I use for preparing it. Among these
you will find programs for loading, viewing, trimming and otherwise
manipulating the fonts. These utilities are also distributed as a
separate archive called fntutlXX.ZIP where XX is the version number.
All the utilities require no shareware payment. Restrictions on
distribution and usage are only to the extent necessary to protect
the free distribution.

I see this is as my pleasant duty to pay tribute to the following
individuals who communicated and contributed to this archive:

This collection would not have been what it today is without their
help!
